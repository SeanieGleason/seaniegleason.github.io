2023 is going to be an exciting new year for me and Spring Boot development!  

![](../assets/img/new-year.jpg)


[3.0.0 was released](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes) at 
the end of 2022, and it is bringing a whole host of changes across the board for J2EE development.  I have a few 
articles lined up, so stay tuned!

I started a 'Special Interest Group' for Spring Boot that has me extremely excited for future projects.
Some of our starting steps include building out Spring Boot education, which I'm planning to share more of here!

See you in the new year!
