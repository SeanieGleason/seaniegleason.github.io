                            Mimosa Ln <br>Ballwin, MO 63011 </strong></p>

                        <p>John is survived by his sisters, Kate Yancey, Mary Jane Miller, and Camille Adams; sons, John
                            and Sean; daughter-in-law Lizabeth Gleason, Rachel Nachtweih. He was also loved and survived
                            by many friends.</p>

                        <p> John Francis Gleason (64) of St. Louis, MO, died January 19, 2020 in Colorado Springs,
                            Colorado. He was born August 3, 1955 to John Aloysius Gleason Sr. and Vesta Louise Gleason
                            (Hedrick). </p>

                        <p>John was known for his warm heart, loving nature, and unequivocal honesty. He enjoyed
                            building his 1964 Ford Econoline with his youngest son, fishing trout out of the Meramec
                            river with his oldest, and above all spending time with his loved ones and sharing his life.
                            John will be remembered for his fighting passion, hard work, and his never ending love for
                            his two sons.</p>

                                    <p>Johnny was an original. Kind and gentle, he was always offering to lend a hand.

                                                John And Camille. We had lots of fun together. He was always inclusive

                                    <p>John was a complete original. One of the funniest people I ever met, always there
                                        to help, never to hinder. We three (Cammy, John, and I) were great friends
                                        during those last years of highschool and just after…a wonderful exploratory
                                        time for us. I remember when he first took off for Texas…oh boy! John was that
                                        guy, whereas the party didn’t really start til he arrived. He was funny beyond
                                        measure (actually hilarious most days) and a great friend. He left no one
                                        behind, always willing to help out even people I didn’t care for…always seeing
                                        the human side of things. He had a big heart and was a true romantic, emanating
                                        that everyday we spent together. I wish him a beautiful peace with the love he
                                        always deserved, a true original. He will be missed.</p>

                                    <p>Johnny was one of my life’s greatest gifts, a true friend, who I could talk to
                                        about anything. He was honest and true to himself. You always knew what he said
                                        was what he meant, and regardless of agreement or disagreement, he never let you
                                        forget he cared. Will forever hold his laughter (often to the point of tears) in
                                        my heart. Miss you JG. Much love to you’re family, who were, and are, the core

                                    <p>My darling sweet brother. I changed his diapers, fed him bottles, chased him
                                        around constantly. He was a very active toddler! A wild teenager and a great
                                        man. He adored John and Sean, our mom and dad, Penny and Jack, his brother Jim,
                                        and us girls, Mary Jane, Camille and myself. In our later years he became a
                                        loyal and great friend to me. A rock when I needed support. Always independent
                                        always cheerful and most of all always equipped with a laugh. My heart is broken
                                        I will miss him forever.</p>

                                    <p>John was a kind and loving parental figure in the lives of many. I will always
                                        remember his encouragement in playing music, opening up his home to young
                                        musicians to practice in the basement…You will be thought of and remembered as a
                                        man with a giant heart, who was a great father, and knew how to have a good
                                        time. Thank you for all the good times we shared, I cherish them deeply.</p>
